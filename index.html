<p><em>I've used GitHub enough and I am considering moving all my old code over from BitBucket.</em>
That's work in progress...</p>

<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I am a keen software developer who likes APIs a whole lot -  I often go to hackathons during weekends to release my inner passion for new ideas and quick code writing/prototyping.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-i-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I do</h3>

<p>A lot of people have been asking me this question. What's my job? What do I do? </p>

<ul>
<li>I write code (js/python/php) and consume APIs. I am also fascinated by complex CSS code :&gt;</li>
<li>I enjoy pushing SaaS products to their limits, analyse their scope and understand what can and cannot be done. Usually that means I'm a keen dev.someproduct.com section reader.</li>
<li>I love to keep up with all the latest trends of technology. Whether it's a new cool library in Nodejs that makes life so much better, a new release of a soft engineering book or learning about that new crypto-algorithm</li>
<li>I tweet a lot</li>
<li>I like to attend and organise technology focused meetups. Meet like minded people over a nice drink is a great feeling</li>
