<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I am a keen software developer who likes APIs a whole lot -  I often go to hackathons during weekends to release my inner passion for new ideas and quick code writing/prototyping. Occasionally watch sport on TV, but only if it's a major event.</p>

<a name="what-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-i-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I do</h3>

<p>A lot of people have been asking me this question. What's my day job? What do I do? </p>

<ul>
<li>I write code (js/python/php) and consume APIs like oxygen. I am also fascinated by complex CSS code :&gt;</li>
<li>I enjoy using SaaS products. I work in the SaaS industry. Usually that means I'm a keen reader and you could find me at dev.yourproduct.com </li>
<li>I like to attend and organise technology focused meetups. Meeting like minded people over a drink is great</li>
<li>Networking runs this world, rest assured that if I know someone that I believe you should meet I'll be introducing you</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="what-else-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-else-do-i-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What else do I do</h3>

<li>I tweet a lot</li>
<li>Oldschool Videogames</li>
