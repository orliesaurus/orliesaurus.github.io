{"name":"orliesaurus.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub page.\r\n*I've used GitHub enough and I am considering moving all my old code over from BitBucket.*\r\nThat's work in progress...\r\n\r\n### About me\r\nI am a keen software developer who likes APIs a whole lot -  I often go to hackathons during weekends to release my inner passion for new ideas and quick code writing/prototyping.\r\n\r\n### What I do\r\nA lot of people have been asking me this question. What's my job? What do I do? \r\n* I write code (js/python/php) and consume APIs. I am also fascinated by complex CSS code :>\r\n* I enjoy pushing SaaS products to their limits, analyse their scope and understand what can and cannot be done. Usually that means I'm a keen dev.someproduct.com section reader.\r\n* I love to keep up with all the latest trends of technology. Whether it's a new cool library in Nodejs that makes life so much better, a new release of a soft engineering book or learning about that new crypto-algorithm\r\n* I tweet a lot\r\n* I like to attend and organise technology focused meetups. Meet like minded people over a nice drink is a great feeling\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
